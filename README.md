# Video Word Search App

This project tries to create a web app that takes any url video, for example youtube, and allows you perform word search in the video. Once the word matches, markers display the timestamps on the video and takes you to the timestamp in the video where the word first appears. You can also traverse consecutive occurences of the word. This was supposed to use spech recognition APIs but they were not free so I tried to use captions from the video, if they had any. However, I cannot seem to access the captions form the video at the moment after multiple tries. Will come back to this project later.
